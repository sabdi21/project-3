## UI-Kits
The UI Kit used for this project is the Now-UI-Kit created by creative Tim.  We used his styling sheets as our base and then created our own App.css file to modify the styling to adapt it to our project environment.


## Future-Goals:
We would like to later add a map feature to display the location of the properties.

We also like to add an events feature displaying events that may be occuring during the stay of the guest.

React-strap didn't work properly with our app, we would like to debug that a little more.
